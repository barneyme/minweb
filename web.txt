FAQ.

How much does MIN WEB cost?
Zero. Zilch. Nada, Nothing.

Can you add this feature?
Nope. MIN WEB is intended to be a minimalist application. If you want more features use Wordpress because it can do all the things. :-)

Why is plaintext great?
Plaintext files can be opened on virtually any device or operating system (Windows PC, Mac, Linux machine, smartphone, or ancient computer.) Plaintext files don't require proprietary software to read and edit them. This universal compatibility means your documents remain accessible regardless of technological changes or software limitations.

Plaintext files are lightweight in file size. This means they have minimal storage requirements and can be copied and transfered quickly. Plaintext is plain FAST!

Plaintext files are future proof. They have no proprietary format dependencies which means you are guaranteed long-term readability and preservation.

Plaintext files are flexibie. With proprietary files you have to follow the makers format. With plaintext files you are in control.

Plaintext files are distraction free. With no formatting (and no annoying auto formatting to fight with) you can just focus on your work.

Plaintext websites are fast and work great on slow internet connections. Some great plaintext websites are:
- DuckDuckGo Lite: https://ddg.gg/lite
- Goosh: https://goosh.org
- 68k News: https://68k.news
- NPR Text: https://text.npr.org
- Plaintext Sports: https://plaintextsports.com
